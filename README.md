# Train Station Indicator using AT89C51

This project simulates a digital train station indicator using an 8051-family microcontroller (AT89C51) and a 16x2 LCD. It displays the name of a railway station ("BORIVALI") and demonstrates basic LCD interfacing using assembly language.

## Overview

- Simulates a station name display seen on platforms or inside coaches.
- Programmed in Assembly language.
- Simulated using Proteus software.
- Uses LCD commands, delay routines, and low-level data control.

## Components

- AT89C51 Microcontroller
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Crystal oscillator (12MHz)
- Capacitors (22pF)
- 10K pull-up resistor
- Push button (reset)
- Potentiometer (for LCD contrast)
- Proteus software (for simulation)
